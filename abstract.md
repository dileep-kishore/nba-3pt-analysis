# The 3-Pointer Problem or the Shooting Revolution?

Basketball since its inception has always been a game dominated by big, strong and atheletic men. But when you look at the game of basketball over the last few years and compare to it to the game it was a decade ago, much has changed. Who would have expected that the NBA that was once dominated by big men, would now become the domain of smaller, quicker players. That's not all that's changed, the league has transitioned from shooting around 2.8 3-pointers per game in the 80's (when the 3-pointer first made it's appearance) to 25.0 in the last season. The Golden State Warriors who made history last season by winning the most games ever in a single season in NBA history (more than any professional sport) did so with their small men line-up, their 3-pointer shooting and their star player Stephen Curry (6'3" and 190lbs). Amid suggestions from all over the NBA that they move the three-point line backward just to compensate for one player or team, the questions I would like to ask and analyze are:
    1. Did this trend start with Stephen Curry and the current Warriors or did they just make the best use of it?
    2. What fraction of the teams have drastically changed their play-style because of this trend?
    3. How does taking more 3-pointers affect the win rate of a team?

Datasets that I would like to use:
    * Basketball Reference (www.basketball-reference.com): By parsing the tables on this website using python.
    * NBA statistics (www.stats.nba.com): By using using the NBA stats api.

I wish to analyze these aspects using a mix of descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing and regression models.
