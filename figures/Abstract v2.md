# The 3-Pointer Problem or the Shooting Revolution?

The basketball of today is a vastly different game from that of a decade ago. Who would have expected that the NBA that was once dominated by big men would now become the domain of smaller, quicker players? That's not all that's changed; the league has transitioned from shooting around 2.8 3-pointers per game in the 80's (when the 3-pointer first made it's appearance) to 25.0 in the last season. The Golden State Warriors who made history last season by winning the most games ever in a single season in NBA history did so with their small men line-up, their 3-pointer shooting and their star player Stephen Curry (6'3" and 190lbs). Amid suggestions from all over the NBA that they move the three-point line backward just to compensate for one player or team, the questions addressed in this study are:
    1. Did this trend start with Stephen Curry and the current Warriors or did they just make the best use of it? Is the trend statistically significant?
    2. How does taking more 3-pointers affect the win rate of a team?
    3. How accurately do 3-pointers predict win rate over the years when compared to the “4 factors” as an indicator?
	4.	What are the trends in 3-pointer attempts across different teams and for Golden State Warriors in particular over the last twenty years?
	5.	Does player build contribute to performance?
